# Peer Angular Challenge

ALL RIGHT! Set up a *NEW* project! From the ground up.
Bring in Angular, that's all we will need for our project today.

## Business Need:
We have been hired by the federal government to help them speed up the process electing a president.
Counting votes takes a long time, so they'd like us to create an application to select a canidate at
random.


## Technical Requirements
Our application will request 2 JSON files from two different Express end points
(one for Republicans and one for Democrats). There should be 5 canidates in each file.

Two button should be put on the view. One to load the canidates, another to kick off the winner selection.
You may display which canidate has been chosen in any way you choose (be creative!).

## Hard Mode:
Style your application with Bootstrap

## Pro Mode:
Add animations to you canidate loading and winner selection.

Once again, the functionality should be similar to what we built in class. NO COPY PASTING CODE from other projects, hand write it.
